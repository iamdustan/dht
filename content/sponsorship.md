## Support DCCDC

Your sponsorship will directly affect the lives of families in your community.

DCCDC is the only non-profit, sliding-scale rate childcare center in our area. Parents
are able to work because their children have a safe, secure, nurturing and affordable
place to be during the day.

Children who attend a pre-K program, like DCCDC, are:

* Less likely to use drugs
* More likely to graduate from high school
* More likely to attend college
* More likely to be employed at age 30
* Less likely to experience health problems like hypertension
* Higher income earners in the future.

Yes, investing in a 3 year-old will change the course of that child’s life.

DCCDC has been in operation for more than 50 years and served many families in our
community. Almost everyone in Town has been touched by DCCDC in some way.
At DCCDC we:

* Provide high-quality, early childhood education with scholarship support for children
6 weeks-Pre-K
* Offer nearly 50% of our mini-scholars sliding-scale financial assistance covering up
to75% of tuition
* Serve a critical need by ensuring that families who could not otherwise afford care
can work to support their families
* Disperse emergency funds to support families with critical costs like rent, diapers,
groceries, and medical care
* Offer one of the few places in our community where children from different
backgrounds meet on equal footing
* Provide a chef-prepared healthy breakfast, lunch, and snack every day, which may be
the only food some of our mini-scholars have access to
* Maintain a 5-star rating for our educational quality and commitment to our
community’s children.
Your sponsorship dollars will go towards scholarships, operating costs, and our
emergency fund.

## Benefits of Sponsorship

The Home & Village tour is an opportunity for you to showcase both your
